# Power Outages and Economic Strength in the United States  
### An Analysis of Outage Severity, Economic Indicators, and Structural Vulnerability (2000–2016)

---

## **1. Introduction**
Power outages disrupt communities, strain infrastructure, and slow economic activity across the United States. While extreme weather and equipment failures are well-known triggers, not every state experiences outages with the same severity. This raises an important question: **do states with stronger economies recover from outages more quickly than those with weaker economies?**

This project explores that question by analyzing **1,534 major U.S. power outage events** recorded from **2000 to 2016**. The dataset provides information on outage duration, customers affected, causes, climate regions, and key economic indicators—including *per-capita real gross state product (PC.REALGSP.STATE)*. By combining outage characteristics with economic strength, this project examines why some outages escalate into major disruptions while others remain contained.

Two primary measures define outage severity:

- **Outage Duration** — how long the power remained out  
- **Customers Affected** — the scale of the impact across households and businesses  

### **Guiding Question**
**Do states with lower per-capita economic output experience longer and more severe power outages?**

Investigating this relationship helps reveal how economic conditions, infrastructure investment, and public policy shape the resiliency of the power grid. Understanding these structural patterns is essential for improving disaster response, infrastructure planning, and community preparedness.
